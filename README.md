Bank Marketing – Machine Learning Models

This repository contains the code used for the experiments in the
CIS111-6 Intelligent Systems and Data Mining assignment.

The project applies several data mining techniques to the Bank Marketing
dataset, including Decision Trees, Random Forests, and CatBoost, in order
to predict customer subscription to a term deposit.

The experiments focus on evaluating model performance using accuracy,
confusion matrices, and cost-based error analysis, with particular
attention to false negative and false positive outcomes.

The code is provided to support the experimental results discussed in
the accompanying academic report.
